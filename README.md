# 🛍️ Product Funnel Visualization

This project demonstrates how to simulate and visualize a user journey funnel using Python and AI-assisted development. It includes synthetic data generation, CSV storage, and funnel chart visualization to analyze user retention across different stages.

## 📦 Project Overview

### 1. AI-Assisted Data Generation
A Python script uses AI guidance to generate realistic user event data for a product funnel. Events include stages like:
- vist
- signup
- try_feature
- Purchase

The generated dataset mimics user behavior across multiple sessions and timestamps.

### 2. CSV Data Storage
The synthetic data is stored in a structured CSV file, making it easy to reuse for analysis, visualization, or dashboard integration.

### 3. Funnel Chart Visualization
A separate Python script reads the CSV and creates a user retention funnel chart using Plotly. This chart helps visualize drop-off rates and conversion across funnel stages.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab
- GitHub
